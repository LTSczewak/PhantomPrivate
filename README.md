# Phantom"Private" Crypter SRC
<h2 align="center">
Here we have "private" release of Phantom. Only releasing this cause some motherfucking noob 3rd-worldlybois are skidding and re-designing it's UI, only to sell an already more than half open-sourced shit for 200+$ in hackforums and TG to gain some money for their daily life necessities...<br>
<br>It's complete latest version, more or less just to expose their scammy faces not in purpose of monetization or anything similar, both .sln and compiled along with required files is in the repository... Anyhow for rest, happy skidding you have everything you need XD<br> </h2>
Edit: Added rootkit uninstaller as well in "Extras" folder.
